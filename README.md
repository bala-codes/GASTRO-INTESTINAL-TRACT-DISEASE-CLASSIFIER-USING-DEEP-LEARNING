# GASTRO INTESTINAL TRACT DISEASE CLASSIFIER USING DEEP LEARNING.

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

In this project, I've trained a deep learning model to classify and localize the diseases present in the GI Tract which can be seen in an Endoscopy procedure.

Dataset available [here](https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/)

## FASTAI PRETRAINED MODELS USED.
- RESNET34 Accuracy --> 95.37 %
- RESNET16 Accuracy --> 95.74 %

Check it out for yourself, RESNET34 in action at [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/GASTRO-INTESTINAL-TRACT-DISEASE-CLASSIFIER-USING-DEEP-LEARNING/blob/master/codes%20(FASTAI)/ENDOSCOPY%20GI%20FASTAI%20RESNET34.ipynb) and RESNET16 in action at [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/GASTRO-INTESTINAL-TRACT-DISEASE-CLASSIFIER-USING-DEEP-LEARNING/blob/master/codes%20(FASTAI)/ENDOSCOPY%20GI%20FASTAI%20RESNET16.ipynb)

Otherwise simply download the pretrained models from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6PnIHvd5bme0saP5yFZBdwUzaYfDrkr/view?usp=sharing) & [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NwVBmYjHN9e-UWbNXT8N890L94WZXvAe/view?usp=sharing) and run it for yourself at [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bala-codes/GASTRO-INTESTINAL-TRACT-DISEASE-CLASSIFIER-USING-DEEP-LEARNING/blob/master/codes%20(FASTAI)/FINAL%20ENDOSCOPY%20GI%20FASTAI%20SINGLE%20INPUT%20PREDICTION.ipynb)

The same models can be extended to create a GradCam mapping and can be fed live video feed for making predictions. I will add the links soon.
In the meantime check the models in action at [DeepScopy - An AI based medical imaging startup](https://deepscopy.com/endoscopy)
